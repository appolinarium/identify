<!-- Shared blog. -->
<!-- Everyone can leave their blog entry, it can be either temporary or eternal. Entries can be filtered and either removed from the output, or their number can be increased from these authors. All without a system of smart algorithms, only user preferences. Filters can always be saved and reset so as not to create a "pit of opinion" problem. Rooms can also be multi-user. -->
