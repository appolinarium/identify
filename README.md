# Indentify
Identify is a user-oriented social network that does not require registration.

## Concept

To use this social network, you do not need a mobile phone number, email, or any other identification data. Any information about you is optional due to the system of private keys that represent your user ID in the system. As for user orientation - this means that content is not in the first place here, as in most other modern social media projects, communication and interaction of users among themselves are in the first place here.

## Built in

- TypeScript
- Vue
- Nuxt
