Describes stylistic solutions and conventions to simplify work and increase productivity wtithin the project.

## Documentation

Each documentation file must be located in `_docs/` drectory of `pages/` and meet the followng requirements:

- `.md` format
- named in *kebab-case*
- include an ordinal *ID* at start of name
- be in *English*

Example:

```bash
12-style-guide.md
```

Any documentation file must match the following format:

```
---
title: "Page title"
permalink: /docs/urlname-for-document
---

Short document summary

## Header 2
...
```

**Tip:** It is better to have several files with links to one another than one huge file.
{: .notice--info}

Custom documentation entities in format `Entity - template`:

- Notice

```
**Tip:** Tip text.
{: .notice-classname}
```

## Commits

Commit comments must match the following format:

```
labels, separated, with, commas: Description
```

Labels are short designations of actions performed in the commits, the full content and purpose of which is known to all project participants. This will help to make more succinct descriptions and reduce the effort spent on them. There can be several labels in one comment separated with commas.

Example:

```bash
git commit -m 'fix, config, localization: Fix localization configuration bug'
``` 

Available labels:

- init (for initial things. For example, for initial integration, initial configuration, scaffolding copying, etc)
- replace (for replacement things. For example, replacement of useState to Pinia)
- move (for moving things)
- rm (for removing things)
- fix (for bug and wrongs fix)
- config (configurations)
- docs (documentation)
- localization (localization files, libraries, configurations and any other similar relations)
- media (fonts, pictures, sounds, etc)

For commits without a suitable label, do not specify anything, except commentary.

**Tip:** divide commits so that they contain one clear logical change. Don't make multiple changes in one commit.
{: .notice--info}

## Branches

Branches should be named in:

- lower-kebab-case

If you have a subbranches, name it separating them with `--`.

For example:

If you making subbranch of `dev`, then you should name it as `dev--subbranch`. If you want to make subbranch of `dev--subbranch`, name it according with `dev--subbranch--subsubbranch`.

There are special types of branches in the project - fix branches. This are temporary branches being created for shared bug fixes. Name them the same as regular branches, but replace `--` with `__`. For example, if we want to fix some bug in `dev--index-page`, name it `dev--index-page__submit-button`.
