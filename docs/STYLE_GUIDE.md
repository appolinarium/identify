# Project style & naming convention

## Documentation

### Naming

Each documentation file name in `md` format must be named in

UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### Format

Necessarily:

- Title
- Short file description
- topics with titles no further than h3
- it is better to have several files with links to one another than one huge one

## Commits

### Naming

```change name also know as label: Short description of changes```

for multiple joins of changes in one commit, use curly brackets. Example:

```integration: { Sass, Rfs }```

But try to avoid a lot of changes in 1 comit. It is better to divide in 2 and more

Available labels:

- integration
- replacement
- remove
- config
- initial
- docs
- other

## Branches

### Naming

Branches should be named in lower and kebab case. Example:

```auth-form-component```
